          <em>
            Egg color depends on the breed of the chicken. For example, White
            Leghorn chickens lay white-shelled eggs, while Plymouth Rocks and
            Rhode Island Reds lay brown-shelled eggs (Source 1, 2)
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Several studies have found that shell color has no significant
            effect on egg quality and composition (3)
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Oops, I ALMOST bought the same colored egg yolks!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          One carton is labeled organic, pasture-raised eggs. The other carton
          is labeled free-range eggs. (Open Nature is the brand name and has
          nothing to do with the type of egg).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The two egg carton labels are clearly different, with distinctive
          keywords labeled to help consumers differentiate the type of egg they
          were going to purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The color of the egg yolk from both carton are both yellow but the
            Organic, Pasture-Raised Egg is deeper in yellow
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Honestly&hellip;.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought the non-organic, free-range carton of eggs would have a
          lighter or more yellower egg-yolk behind the brown-colored shell.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am going to make it easier for you to compare the egg cartons
          without using too many words. You can view the comparison chart I
          created below to evaluate yourself.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to extend the opportunity for you to be a smarter consumer when
          it comes to the type of eggs you like to eat. I&rsquo;m sure that many
          consumers are confused as they walk down the aisles of their local
          grocery store with only their{" "}
          <strong>&lsquo;this is what I grew up on&rsquo;</strong> lens and
          wanting to save a few dollars to end up with a lower quality carton of
          eggs.

            What is the difference between organic and non-organic eggs?

        </p>
        <p>
          First and foremost, to receive the USDA organic stamp, farmers will
          need to pass this set of requirements. Naturally, meeting a higher set
          of standards could be inferred as a higher quality product. This stamp
          confirms this hypothetical.

          <em>
            Organic food certification is a self-regulated term depending on the
            national government that regulates it. In the United States, organic
            foods must not have any artificial food additives or genetically
            modified ingredients. In addition, organic foods must refrain from
            artificial methods, materials, and conditions like chemical ripening
            and food irradiation. Organic farmers can use pesticides as long as
            they are not synthetic. However, if pests and weeds are too
            difficult to manage through organic pesticides or herbicides,
            synthetic substances that are approved on the National List of
            synthetic substances can be used.
