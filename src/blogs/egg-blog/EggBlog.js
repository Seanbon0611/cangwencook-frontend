        <em>
          Egg color depends on the breed of the chicken. For example, White
          Leghorn chickens lay white-shelled eggs, while Plymouth Rocks and
          Rhode Island Reds lay brown-shelled eggs (Source 1, 2)
        </em>
      </p>

        <em>
          Several studies have found that shell color has no significant effect
          on egg quality and composition (3)

      <p>
        <strong>Oops, I ALMOST bought the same colored egg yolks!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        One carton is labeled organic, pasture-raised eggs. The other carton is
        labeled free-range eggs. (Open Nature is the brand name and has nothing
        to do with the type of egg).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        The two egg carton labels are clearly different, with distinctive
        keywords labeled to help consumers differentiate the type of egg they
        were going to purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          The color of the egg yolk from both carton are both yellow but the
          Organic, Pasture-Raised Egg is deeper in yellow
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Honestly&hellip;.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought the non-organic, free-range carton of eggs would have a
        lighter or more yellower egg-yolk behind the brown-colored shell.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am going to make it easier for you to compare the egg cartons without
        using too many words. You can view the comparison chart I created below
        to evaluate yourself.&nbsp;

        I want to extend the opportunity for you to be a smarter consumer when
        it comes to the type of eggs you like to eat. I&rsquo;m sure that many
        consumers are confused as they walk down the aisles of their local
        grocery store with only their{" "}
        <strong>&lsquo;this is what I grew up on&rsquo;</strong> lens and
        wanting to save a few dollars to end up with a lower quality carton of
        eggs.

          What is the difference between organic and non-organic eggs?
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        First and foremost, to receive the USDA organic stamp, farmers will need
        to pass this set of requirements. Naturally, meeting a higher set of
        standards could be inferred as a higher quality product. This stamp
        confirms this hypothetical.

        <em>
          Organic food certification is a self-regulated term depending on the
          national government that regulates it. In the United States, organic
          foods must not have any artificial food additives or genetically
          modified ingredients. In addition, organic foods must refrain from
          artificial methods, materials, and conditions like chemical ripening
          and food irradiation. Organic farmers can use pesticides as long as
          they are not synthetic. However, if pests and weeds are too difficult
          to manage through organic pesticides or herbicides, synthetic
          substances that are approved on the National List of synthetic
          substances can be used.
