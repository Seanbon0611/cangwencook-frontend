        <h2>What is your cooking style?</h2>
        <p className="about-p">
          I am an amatuer home cook at heart. CanGwenCook is my way of sharing
          some fun recipes using everyday ingredients which you can pick up at
          your local grocery store.
        </p>
        <h2>Who are you cooking for?</h2>
        <p className="about-p">
          I can honestly say that I am better at cooking for a smaller group of
          4-6 people. The size of my kitchen and cookware are made for a couple
          + a few friends, thus, making massive amounts of food just isnâ€™t going
          to happen.
        </p>
        <p className="about-p">
          Typically, my cooking is focused on a protein and veggie diet with
          minimal carbs.
        </p>
        <p className="about-p">
          When I do cook carbs, I would cook a rice substitute like quinoa or
          chickpea rice or whole wheat pasta.
        </p>
        <h2>What are some of your favorite recipes?</h2>
        <p className="about-p">
          I love making Keto-friendly macadamia bread which I can use as a
          vehicle for millennial toast like Smoked Salmon & Avocado macbread
          toast.
        </p>
        <p className="about-p">
          One of my go-to is an open face shrimp fiesta bowl with lentil rice
          and parmesan cheese.
        </p>
        <p className="about-p">
          {" "}
          My husband loves the chichiron-breaded chicken parmesan baked with
          your choice of yummy cheese.
        </p>
        <p className="about-p">
          We both enjoy our cheddar bay almond flour biscuits for snacks and as
          a substitute for carbs.
        </p>
        <h2>What are you passionate about when you are not cooking?</h2>
