        Hi, my name is Gwen and welcome to my online collection of ‘flexible’
        keto-inspired recipes!{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        What is your cooking style? I love to call it: Chopped-style Keto
        Cooking What is Chopped-style Keto Cooking? Imagine opening up your
        refrigerator, freezer, or dry pantry and creating delicious food with
        the ingredients you have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recipes are created with creativity - a ‘Chopped’ style format to
        transform an ingredient which would fit into a keto-inspired\ diet where
        it is low in carbs and sugars but packed with flavor. What are some of
        your favorite recipes?

        I love making Keto-friendly macadamia bread which I can use as a vehicle
        for millennial toast like Smoked Salmon & Avocado macbread toast. One of
        my go-to is an open face shrimp fiesta bowl with lentil rice and
        parmesan cheese. My husband loves the chichiron-breaded chicken parmesan
        baked with your choice of yummy cheese.
